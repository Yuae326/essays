In *Idle Hours*, Chase masterfully captures a sense of calm and relaxation. The painting portrays his wife, sister, and two daughters seated on the dunes at eastern Long Island, gazing out at the serene ocean. Their relaxed pose, combined with the soft colors of the beach and water, creates an atmosphere of tranquility. The gentle light enhances the peacefulness of the scene, offering a contrast to the urbanization and industrialization of the time. Rather than depicting activity, Chase emphasizes leisure, making the sea a symbol of retreat and peace, a place where his family could escape the pressures of modern life.

Similarly, *The Open Air Breakfast* showcases a carefully arranged scene that blends casual relaxation with artistic arrangement. The painting includes Chase’s sister in a Dutch-style hat, his wife with a Chinese cap, and his sister-in-law in a hammock, alongside a Russian wolfhound. Chase’s Brooklyn yard, depicted with a Japanese screen and potted tropical plant, reflects his eclectic tastes and sophisticated collection. Through this scene, Chase integrates leisurely domestic life with cultural elements, celebrating both relaxation and artistic refinement.
